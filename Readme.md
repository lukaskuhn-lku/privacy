## Children's Privacy

Our application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on our website, and the "Last Updated" date will be modified accordingly.
